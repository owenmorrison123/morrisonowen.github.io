  <h4>Favorite Hobby</h4>
  <p>My favorite hobby is hanging out with friends. We talk about sports a lot, which is also one of my favorite hobbies. Sports are very interesting to me, and I really enjoy watching games. Being at games in person is a great experience that I think everyone should experience. These are my favorite hobbies!</p>
